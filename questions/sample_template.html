<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>
    In Russia, the Value Added Tax is 18% for almost all goods, with the exception of certain food items, which have a Value Added Tax of only 10%.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a String product, the name of a product, and an int price, the price of the product before tax. You are also given a String[] food, each element of which is the name of a food product. If the given product is an element in food, it is a food item (and thus subject to 10% tax), and otherwise, it is a non-food item (and thus subject to 18% tax). Return the price of the product after tax has been added.
